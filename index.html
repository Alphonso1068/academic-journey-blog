        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          My academic journey has been filled with curiosity, challenges,
          lessons, and growth. From my early days in pre‑school to becoming a
          fourth‑year university student, each stage shaped my discipline,
          character, and aspirations.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          My academic life began in pre‑school, where I was introduced to
          structured learning. Activities such as singing, drawing, and
          storytelling helped develop my curiosity and social skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Learning becomes meaningful when
          curiosity is encouraged early.

        <p>
          I joined
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank"
            >Itumbe Highway Primary School</a
          >, where discipline, consistency, and responsibility were emphasized.
          Teachers played a major role in shaping my academic attitude.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Academic discipline</li>
          <li>Sports and group activities</li>
          <li>Early leadership skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Consistency and discipline are key to
          success.

          <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank"
            >Nyamache Boys High School</a

          influence and time management were major challenges.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Regrets:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Not taking academics seriously at certain stages</li>
